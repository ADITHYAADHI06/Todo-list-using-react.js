The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic and interactive To-Do List application using React.js. The application will allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. It will provide features such as task creation, task editing, task completion, task filtering, and task deletion.

Key Features:

User Interface: Design and implement a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the To-Do List application. The interface should include a task input field, a list of tasks, and options to interact with each task.

Task Creation: Allow users to add new tasks to the list. Provide an input field where users can enter the task description and a button to submit the task. Upon submission, the task should be added to the list of tasks.

Task Editing: Enable users to modify task details. Implement an edit functionality that allows users to change the description of an existing task. This can be achieved by providing an edit button or by enabling inline editing directly on the task item.

Task Completion: Implement the ability for users to mark tasks as complete. Provide a checkbox or a button for users to indicate that a task has been completed. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from active tasks.

Task Filtering: Allow users to filter tasks based on their completion status. Provide options such as "All Tasks," "Active Tasks," and "Completed Tasks" to filter the task list accordingly. This will help users focus on specific subsets of their tasks.

Task Deletion: Enable users to delete tasks from the list. Provide a delete button or an icon next to each task item, allowing users to remove tasks that are no longer needed.

Task Persistence: Implement functionality to persist the task data. This can be achieved by using local storage to store and retrieve task data. Ensure that the tasks remain intact even after refreshing or closing the application.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well across different devices and screen sizes. It should adapt to various platforms, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as network errors, data validation errors, or unexpected issues gracefully. Display error messages or fallback options to guide users in case of any problems.


By developing a To-Do List application using React.js, this project aims to create a responsive, user-friendly, and feature-rich task management tool that helps users stay organized and productive.
